Nice is basically used to start a process with some specified priority
Renice is used to change the priority of existing process.
Each process has a nice valuue ranging from -20 to 19.

-20(Highest Priority)
19(Lowest Priority)

By Default new process start with nice value 0

to check it we can run top command.


we can see priority is 20 and nice value is -1 then priority becomes 19
 
Higher the value means low priority
(the process is nicer than other) 

Lower the nice value means higher priority
(requires root access for negative values)

Start a script with nice value 10:
 nice -n 10 script-name


 Let's Create script
 
Script to be written in WSL
mkdir developers
cd developers
nano myscript.sh
----------------------------
#! /bin/bash
echo "Start My Script with Priority $(nice)"
sleep 100 ## Just wait for 100 seconds
echo "Script Completed Successfully"

to save --> ctrl+O and then press enter 
then --> ctrl + X

check the content written: 
cat myscript.sh

to start a script with default priority:
sh myscript.sh & (& to run it in background)
to exit: ctrl+c (but still your process must be running)

to check the nice value: jobs -l (to see process id)

then: top -p process-id (top -p 1250)
you can see the nice and priority values

once the the process Completed ctrl+c

run it again with nice: nice -n -10 sh myscript.sh &
(ctrl+c) check proces id and then check priority values.

again you can check: top -p process-id
(you can see the priority 30)

now to update priority you can use renice:
sudo renice -10 proces-id 

top -p proces-id (priority must be updated)
end
