Nice is basically used to start a process with some specified priority
Renice is used to change the priority of existing process.
Each process has a nice valuue ranging from -20 to 19.

-20(Highest Priority)
19(Lowest Priority)

By Default new process start with nice value 0

to check it we can run top command.


we can see priority is 20 and nice value is -1 then priority becomes 19
 
Higher the value means low priority
(the process is nicer than other) 

Lower the nice value means higher priority
(requires root access for negative values)

Start a script with nice value 10:
 nice -n 10 script-name
